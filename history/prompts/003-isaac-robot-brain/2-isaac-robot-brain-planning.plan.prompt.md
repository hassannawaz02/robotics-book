# Isaac Robot Brain Module Planning

## User Input

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Completed comprehensive planning for Module 3 - AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) including:

- **Technical Context**: Defined Python 3.11+, JavaScript/TypeScript, Docusaurus 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim/ROS/Nav2, JWT authentication
- **Constitution Check**: Verified compliance with all 6 constitutional principles (Content-First, Modular Architecture, Authentication-Driven Access, Docusaurus Integration, Simulation-Ready Design, AI-Enhanced Learning)
- **Project Structure**: Outlined module directory structure with lessons, assets, and code examples
- **Research**: Created research.md with decisions on JWT implementation, Docusaurus integration, Isaac content structure, file organization, and AI-enhanced learning preparation
- **Data Model**: Defined entities for Lesson Content, User Access, Module Structure, and Code Examples with relationships and validation rules
- **API Contracts**: Created lesson access API specification with JWT authentication
- **Quickstart Guide**: Developed setup steps, key components, and testing procedures
- **Agent Context Update**: Updated CLAUDE.md with new technologies for the Isaac ecosystem
