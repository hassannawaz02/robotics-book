# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI-Driven Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module focuses on physics simulation and environment building using Gazebo and Unity.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will develop skills in:

- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- Creating high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs
- Building complete digital twin environments
