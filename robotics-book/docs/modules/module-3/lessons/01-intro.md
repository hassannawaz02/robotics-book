# Introduction to Isaac Ecosystem

Welcome to Module 3 - AI-Robot Brain, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac™ technologies. This module covers:

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation
- Nav2 for path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to set up and use Isaac Sim for simulation
- How to implement navigation with Isaac ROS
- How to plan paths for humanoid robots with Nav2

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim installed
- Python 3.11+ environment
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts

## Overview of the Isaac Ecosystem

The NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing, testing, and deploying robotics applications:

The ecosystem consists of three main components that work together to enable sophisticated robotics applications:

1. **Isaac Sim** - A photorealistic simulation environment for testing and training
2. **Isaac ROS** - Hardware-accelerated perception and navigation algorithms
3. **Nav2** - Advanced path planning capabilities, especially for humanoid robots

In the following lessons, we'll explore each component in detail and learn how to integrate them into a complete AI-robot brain system.
