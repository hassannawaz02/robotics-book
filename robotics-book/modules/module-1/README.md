# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the "nervous system" of robotic applications. It focuses on core concepts including nodes, topics, services, and URDF for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, learners will understand:
- Core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services
- How to create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
- Communication patterns in distributed robotic systems
- URDF for robot modeling, especially for humanoid robots
- How to bridge Python agents to ROS 2 controllers

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- A working ROS 2 installation (recommended: Humble Hawksbills or later)
