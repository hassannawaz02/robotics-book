# Code Examples for Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This directory contains code examples for the Digital Twin module covering Gazebo and Unity simulation environments.

## Directory Structure

- `python/gazebo-scripts/` - Python scripts for Gazebo simulation
- `python/unity-scripts/` - Python scripts for Unity simulation

## Gazebo Scripts

- `basic_simulation.py` - Basic Gazebo simulation example with robot spawning and state management

## Unity Scripts

- `basic_simulation.py` - Basic Unity simulation example with sensor data simulation

## Dependencies

To run these examples, you'll need:

- Python 3.11+
- Gazebo (for Gazebo examples)
- Unity (for Unity examples)
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt when created)

## Usage

Each script is a placeholder that demonstrates the structure for the actual implementation. Follow the lessons in the module to understand how to implement these examples with real functionality.
