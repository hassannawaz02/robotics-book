# Building Gazebo Environments

## Overview

This lesson focuses on creating comprehensive simulation environments in Gazebo. You'll learn to build complex scenes with models, lighting, and physics properties.

## Learning Objectives

- Create SDF (Simulation Description Format) files
- Import and configure 3D models
- Set up lighting and rendering properties
- Configure environment parameters

## Gazebo Environment Components

A complete Gazebo environment includes:

- World files (.world) defining the scene
- Model files (.sdf) for objects
- Plugin configurations
- Physics engine settings

## Creating World Files

World files define the complete simulation environment:

- Spawning models at specific locations
- Setting up lighting conditions
- Configuring physics parameters
- Adding plugins for custom behaviors

## Model Integration

Learn to:

- Import 3D models in various formats
- Configure collision and visual properties
- Set up model hierarchies
- Create custom models from scratch

## Environment Optimization

Techniques for optimizing Gazebo environments:

- Level of detail (LOD) management
- Physics simplification
- Rendering optimization
- Performance tuning

## Hands-On Exercise

Create a complete indoor environment with furniture, lighting, and physics properties.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll explore Unity's capabilities for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction.
