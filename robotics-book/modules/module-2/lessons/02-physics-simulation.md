# Physics Simulation Fundamentals

## Overview

This lesson covers the core concepts of physics simulation in digital twin environments. You'll learn how to implement realistic physics behaviors in both Gazebo and Unity.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand physics engines and their role in digital twins
- Implement gravity and collision detection
- Configure physical properties for objects
- Test physics interactions in simulation

## Physics in Digital Twins

Physics simulation is crucial for creating realistic digital twins. Key concepts include:

- Gravity simulation
- Collision detection and response
- Mass and inertia properties
- Friction and damping effects

## Gazebo Physics Implementation

Gazebo uses the ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) for physics simulation. You'll learn to:

- Configure physics parameters in SDF files
- Set up collision meshes
- Adjust gravity and other physical properties
- Implement custom physics plugins

## Unity Physics Implementation

Unity's physics engine provides:

- Rigidbody components for objects
- Collision detection and trigger systems
- Joint constraints and articulation
- Custom physics materials

## Hands-On Exercise

In this exercise, you'll create a simple physics scene with falling objects and collision detection in both environments.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll explore creating complete Gazebo environments with custom models and scenarios.
