# Introduction to Digital Twin Technology

## Overview

This module introduces digital twin technology and its applications in robotics and physical AI. You'll learn how to create simulated environments using Gazebo and Unity for testing and development purposes.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of digital twin technology
- Learn about Gazebo and Unity as simulation platforms
- Set up your development environment for digital twin creation
- Explore the benefits of simulation in robotics development

## What You'll Learn

Digital twin technology creates virtual replicas of physical systems. In robotics, this allows for:
